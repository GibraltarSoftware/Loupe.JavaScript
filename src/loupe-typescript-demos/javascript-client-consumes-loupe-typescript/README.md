# javascript-client-consumes-loupe-typescript

This is a simple JavaScript app to show how the transpiled loupe-typescript project can be easily consumed from within a raw JavaScript client.

## Steps to run the application

1) Install the dependencies specified in package.json by running <code>npm install</code>

2) Serve the app from the **./dist** folder by running <code>npm run start</code>

The browser should start up instructing you to "Press F12 and view the Network tab" where it should be apparent that the application has attempted the loupe/log call.
